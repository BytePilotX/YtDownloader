Hello, thanks for downloading youtube video/audio downloader
I will try to update this as much as I can, if there is any errors file an issue on the 
github repository so I can sort it. -- that-linux-programmer

**NOTES:**

PLEASE RUN THE INSTALL SCRIPT AND THEN RUN YTDOWNLOADER

EVEN IF YOU ALREADY HAVE PYTHON:
 - GO TO COMMANDLINE -> VISUAL REPRESENTATION IN THE IMAGE THAT CAME WITH THIS DOWNLOAD
 - TYPE 'python3'
 - INSTALL PYTHON FROM MS STORE
 - THEN RUN INSTALLSCRIPT
 - THEN YTDOWNLOADER WILL BE CONFIGURED FOR YOU TO USE!
